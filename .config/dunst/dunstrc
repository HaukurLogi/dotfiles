    # The geometry of the window:
    #   [{width}]x{height}[+/-{x}+/-{y}]
    # The geometry of the message window.
    # The height is measured in number of notifications everything else
    # in pixels.  If the width is omitted but the height is given
    # ("-geometry x2"), the message window expands over the whole screen
    # (dmenu-like).  If width is 0, the window expands to the longest
    # message displayed.  A positive x is measured from the left, a
    # negative from the right side of the screen.  Y is measured from
    # the top and down respectively.
    # The width can be negative.  In this case the actual width is the
    # screen width minus the width defined in within the geometry option.

    # strip: This setting is provided for compatibility with some broken
    #        clients that send markup even though it's not enabled on the
    #        server. Dunst will try to strip the markup but the parsing is
    #        simplistic so using this option outside of matching rules for
    #        specific applications *IS GREATLY DISCOURAGED*.
    #
    # no:    Disable markup parsing, incoming notifications will be treated as
    #        plain text. Dunst will not advertise that it has the body-markup
    #        capability if this is set as a global setting.
    #

    # regardless of what this is set to.
